[Fog clears as two titans emerge from a vast sea.]

??? [V.O.]
Long ago,
the world was nothing more than an endless sea
cloaked in a boundless sky,
reaching as far as could possibly be imagined.

[The titans begin to fight each other with massive swords. One uses a sword of
earth and metal, while the other wields a blade of brilliant blue light.]

??? [V.O.]
Then two great titans came into existence.
The Bionis and the Mechonis.

[With its blade of light, the Bionis cuts off the arm of the Mechonis, which
falls into the sea below. The Mechonis now wielding its sword with one hand,
the two continue their duel.]

??? [V.O.]
The titans were locked in a timeless battle.

[The Mechonis strikes the Bionis in its side as the blade of the Bionis digs
into the Mechonis.]

??? [V.O.]
Until at last...
Only their lifeless corpses remained.

[The screen stretches as the screen fades to white, then to black.]

??? [V.O.]
Eons have passed.

[Brief flashes of light can be seen, glimpses of a battle which is raging
through the haze.]

??? [V.O.]
Now our world,
this vast land stretching across
the remains of the Bionis,
is under attack from a relentless
force known as the Mechon.

[Soldiers are shown fighting a hard battle against their mechanical foes, the
Mechon, on a desolate field. These Mechon forces begin to overwhelm the people
of Bionis.]

Defence Force Soldier
Retreat! Retreat!

[A mobile artillery blows up some Mechon, but the machines keep advancing and
attacking fallen soldiers.]

Defence Force Soldier
Get away from me!

[As the Mechon advance, one soldier is using his mobile artillery's radio.]

Defence Force Soldier
Number of M78 Mechon is unknown!

[This soldier is quickly taken by a Mechon's pincers and tossed to the Mechon
behind it. As soldiers continue to retreat, one hero, Dunban, dashes in the
opposite direction, towards the battle, and slices through Mechon with ease
wielding a blade of intense blue light, much like the sword of the Bionis.]

Dunban
They're advancing down our weak right flank.
For a bunch of soulless machines,
they seem to know a thing or two.
But we'll see.

[Dunban activates his sword again as two of his comrades-in-arms, Dickson and
Mumkhar, run to his side. The group has a hiding place behind an overturned
vehicle as the battle rages around them.]

Dickson
Dunban!
We've been given the order to retreat.
We're pulling back the line to Colony 6.
That's where we'll set up the last line of defence!

Dunban
Yeah. That's a good idea.
Any more time spent hanging around here
and we're done for.

Mumkhar
Count me in! We've gotta get outta here.

Dunban
Or we can stay and fight?

Mumkhar
What?!

[An explosion rocks the place where the three are holing up.]

Dunban
We may die if we take a stand here.
But staying gives us the chance
to change our destinies.
We have the Monado.

[Dunban takes up his sword, the Monado.]

Dunban
With this, the future is ours for the taking!

[Dunban leaps up to re-engage the Mechon, but Dickson pulls him back down.]

Dickson
Stupid beast!
Your body can't take any more of the Monado.
I can tell by just looking at you!

Dunban
Getting short sighted in your old age, Dickson?
I'm fine. Don't worry,
I'm still in control.

Dickson
I should've known I couldn't talk sense into a beast.
Let's do this. I'm going with you!
You'll need someone to drag your corpse home.

Dunban
As long as you think you've still got
the strength in you, old man.

Mumkhar
Oi, you two! We've been ordered
to pull back! I'm leaving!

Dunban
Well I say you're coming with us!
What would we do without those?

[Dunban looks at the Steel Claws with which Mumkhar is equipped, as the latter
makes a noise of disgust.]

Defence Force Soldier
The enemy's second wave is approaching!

Dickson
It's now or never, Dunban.
Let's show them what we've got.
We'll give them a warm Homs welcome!

Dunban
Acknowledged!

[Dunban and Dickson leap into battle, leaving Mumkhar by himself.]

Mumkhar
What're they trying to prove?!
I'm not throwing my life away! No point
dying in some godforsaken field.

[Mumkhar rises nevertheless.]

Mumkhar
Nothing for it.
I'll have to use Dunban as a decoy.
That should give me time to escape.

[Together the three fight off one horde of Mechon, only to see another legion
of them approaching.]

Mumkhar
You've got to be kidding!

Dickson
It's their main force.
Looks like the Mechon are
hell-bent on taking us out.

Dunban
They'll have to be if they want to beat us.
Now, let's even the odds a bit!

Dickson [to Mumkhar]
You heard him.

[Mumkhar looks around in despair as Dunban activates the Monado.]

Dunban
Dickson, Mumkhar.
Let's do this!

[Dunban uses the Monado to Enchant his two comrades with a glowing purple light
as the three tear through more Mechon. Finally, Dickson sees Dunban atop a pile
of destroyed Mechon, crying out painfully as he's overwhelmed by the Monado,
which eventually deactivates as Dunban collapses off the pile. A lone Mechon
approaches the fallen warrior.]

Dickson
Dunban!

[Dickson throws himself on Dunban, taking the hit meant for the latter, then
fights off the Mechon and throws it down off the pile.]

Dickson
I ain't going down that easily!
Dunban! You all right?!

[Dunban sits clasping the Monado in apparent exhaustion.]

Dunban
What does it look like?
I'm still good to go!

[Elsewhere on the field, out of earshot, Mumkhar rises, laughing.]

Mumkhar
Guess even a hero's gotta
reach his limit eventually.

[As Dickson helps Dunban to safety, the latter notices Mumkhar fleeing.]

Dunban
Mumkhar?! What are you
doing?! That way is-

Mumkhar
Sorry, brothers!
Hate to drop this on you, but
it's the Monado they're after.
So have fun keeping 'em occupied for me!
I'm getting the hell outta here!

Dickson
Mumkhar, you dirty...

Mumkhar
Don't worry. I'll organise your funerals!
Well, see ya boys!

Dickson
Wait!

[As Mumkhar runs off, an explosion sends Dickson and Dunban crashing to the
ground. In the aftermath, a massive Mechon fortress unit approaches.]

Dickson
If this is a joke, it ain't funny.
Looks like this is it.
At least we know our luck can't
get any worse from here.

[Dunban gets to his feet.]

Dickson
Dunban?

Dunban
Dickson, take care of the survivors.

[Dunban activates the Monado.]

Dickson
Dunban, what are you playing at?!

[Meanwhile, Mumkhar is running away to a separate part of the battlefield.]

Mumkhar
Those idiots.
I'll just come and get the Monado when
everything's quietened down a bit.
That thing's gonna be mine!

[Mumkhar suddenly slips down the incline and takes a fall. At the bottom, red
laser lights appear all over his body as unseen Mechon target him.]

Mumkhar
Oh no! Please!

[Mumkhar cries out in despair as elsewhere Dunban is shown holding the Monado.]

Dunban
Vile Mechon!
If you think the Homs,
the people of Bionis,
are just waiting here for you to pick us off...
You are sorely mistaken!

[Dunban rushes at the Mechon force as the view zooms out from him to the
battlefield, to Sword Valley as a whole, to different regions of Bionis, and
finally all the way out to the two titans locked in eternal combat upon which
this whole world is based.]
